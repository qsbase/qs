Version 0.16.1 (2019-5-15)

   * Support for zstd streaming interface.  As opposed to block compression routines, streaming compression offers better compression ratio but is not as fast
   * Update zstd to version 1.4.0
   * Re-factor configure script to not be so messy
   * Change file suffixes in examples from "q" to "qs" (https://github.com/traversc/qs/issues/5)
   * (Not included) brotli compression library was evaluated, but did not offer better performance compared to zstd on average
   * Updated zstd to version 1.4.0 (from 1.3.8) and lz4 to 1.9.1 (from 1.8.2)
   * C++ macro compiler warnings fixed in zstd; this needs to be done every time zstd is updated (https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/1538)

Version 0.15.1 (2019-04-07)

   * Initial multi-threading support using C++11 concurrency
   * Added support for lz4HC (high compression lz4 variant, but slower compression)
   * Additional error check handling to verify file integrity; see `qinspect` function
   * Additional documentation and examples
   * Normalize file paths before attempting to write or read (https://github.com/traversc/qs/issues/4)
   * Added star name database from the International Astronomical Union; see `?starnames`

Version 0.14.1  (2019-03-03)

   * Support for LZ4 compression codec
   * Defined several compression presets: "fast", "balanced" and "high" which trade speed for compression ratio
   * Byte shuffling routines adapted from the BLOSC library, for higher compression ratios
   * Utility functions for compressing and decompressing raw data using zstd or lz4

Version 0.13.1  (2019-02-13)

   * Added configure file to detect system installation of zstd
   * Fixes to "undefined behavior" (C++ unaligned type casts)

Version 0.12 (2019-02-08)

   * Initial CRAN release
   * This package provides serialization of R objects through block compression with zstd
   * Utilizes Alt-rep data to quickly de-serialize string data
